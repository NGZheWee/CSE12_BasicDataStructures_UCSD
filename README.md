# CSE12: Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design (Spring 2021, UCSD)

This repository contains coursework from **CSE12: Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design**, which I took in Fall 2022 at UC San Diego. The course focused on fundamental data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming principles. Key topics include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and algorithm efficiency.

## Contents:

- **Homework**: Contains homework assignments focusing on the implementation and analysis of basic data structures and object-oriented design concepts.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Heaps.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Searching (Binary Search), Recursion.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism.
- **Efficiency and Complexity**: Understanding and analyzing algorithmic time complexity using Big O notation.
- **Problem Solving**: Applying data structures and algorithms to solve complex computational problems.

## How to Navigate:

- **Homework**: All homework assignments are located under the `Homework/` directory, each containing relevant code and documentation for understanding and applying various data structures and object-oriented design principles.
