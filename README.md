# CSE12: Basic Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design (Fall 2022, UCSD)

This repository contains my coursework from **CSE12**, which I took in Fall 2022 at UC San Diego. The course focused on fundamental data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming principles. Key topics include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and algorithm efficiency.

## Contents:

- **Homework**: Contains homework assignments focused on the implementation and analysis of basic data structures and object-oriented design concepts.

## How to Navigate:

- **Homework**: You can find all homework assignments under the `Homework/` directory. Each assignment folder contains code related to data structure implementations, problem-solving techniques, and algorithm performance analysis.
